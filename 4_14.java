// Every member of your secret club has an ID number. These ID numbers are between 1 and 1,000,000 
// and have two special characteristics: They are multiples of 7 and all end with a 3 in the oneâ€™s 
// place. For example, 63 is the smallest such value, and 999,943 is the largest such value. Write a 
// program that prompts the user for an int value, reads it in, and then says whether or not it could 
// be used as an ID number. Note: You need to use the modulus operator in two different ways to test 
// the value correctly.
